# 0.9 Release Notes

Thanks to all the testers and contributors that helped make version 0.9! Special thanks to @thepurple and the team at Namecheap. We are very excited to have fixed many bugs and added new features in version 0.9.

## Known Issues

- Fractional scaling issues are not resolved. We are working with Qt upstream on this issue.
- KDE Wayland requires modification to the Desktop file. (#1380)

## New Features

- Improved MacOS support. MacOS is now officially supported and we will resolve any reported issues on this platform.
- Thanks to SignPath we are able to offer digitally signed windows releases.
- Improved Wayland support on Gnome
  * Behind the scenes we configure flameshot to automatically run on xcb. This significantly improves the wayland experience. This resolves issues with multimonitor setups and copying to the clipboard
- Ability to run flameshot on Sway
- New option to allow the the clipboard image to be a jpeg instead of a png. This may reduce bandwidth when pasting the image into chat or email clients
- New global shortcut menu. All actions hotkeys are fully customizable.
- Ability to take "symmetric" selections by holding down the Shift key while resizing the selection.
- The rectangle tool will now round the corners of the rectangles based on the current thickness
- All imgur uploads are now tracked in the "Upload History" menu. This makes it much easier to delete of images off imgur or find the upload link later.
- Added "check for new release" feature. This allows users on MacOS / Windows / and AppImages to easily check for updated versions.
- New option for setting a "fixed save path". When this is enabled a user will no longer need to set the path for images that are saved.

## Fixes

- Under certain circumstance the circle count could get set to the wrong number with large numbers of undo / redo. This has been fixed.
- Close after capture has been removed. This feature was not well implemented and lead to numerous bugs.
